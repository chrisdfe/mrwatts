##Known Bugs
<ol>
	<li>Some scale/progression/melody combinations sound really terrible.</li>
</ol>
##TODO:
<ol>
	<li>Support for a single sequence being in a different mode, to do things like switch to dorian for the IV chord</li>
	<li>Percussion</li>
	<li>Motifs/themes -- snippets that are reused to make a coherent melody</li>
	<li>Sequence categorization -- sequences that go only at the beginning of a phrase, at the end, or both</li>
	<li>Add support for progressions intended only for major keys, or minor keys, or both.</li>
	<li>Combine the basslines and chords data into the same json file to give them greater independence from each other while still being connected</li>
	<li>If the phrase ends before the measure, add an appropriate amount of silence to fill the rest of the measure up</li>
	<li>Support for different instruments</li>
	<li>Some major refactoring/separating into multiple files</li>
</ol>
