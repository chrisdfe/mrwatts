### TODO:
<ol>
	<li>Have chords, bassline and melody be based on a common progression</li>
	<li>Support for a single sequence being in a different mode, to do things like switch to dorian for the IV chord</li>
	<li>Percussion</li>
	<li>Motifs/themes -- snippets that are reused to make a coherent melody</li>
	<li>Refactoring/Cleanup</li>
	<li>Add support progressions intended only for major keys, or minor keys, as well as ones that work for both.</li>
	<li>Combine the basslines and chords data into the same json file to give them greater independence from each other while still being connected</li>
</ol>
